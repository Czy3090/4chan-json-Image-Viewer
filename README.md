# 4chan-json-Image-Viewer
View all images in a thread on 4chan in a simple image only view.
for Use with https://www.tampermonkey.net/ web browser extension

Choose the Thread post you want to view the images on and simply copy the thread number (000000) in the url address bar and paste in in the following url
Original url: "https://boards.4chan.org/wg/thread/000000/POSTNAME"
Break down of new URL:"https://a.4cdn.org/" + forum  + "/thread/" + Thread number + ".json"
example of new URL: https://a.4cdn.org/wg/thread/000000.json

with this add-on you will only see the images on the thread you selected, clicking a image will open the image in a new page.
no more scrolling just to view the threads images.
works best with a image hover add-on (might add this function in a future update)
