# 4chan-json-Image-Viewer
View all images in a thread on 4chan in a simple image only view</br>
for Use with https://www.tampermonkey.net/ web browser extension</br></br>

!! Not a replacement for visiting 4chan threads !!</br>
just a productive way to sort thought the images you want, without the text and scrolling you dont want.</br></br>

Choose the Thread post you want to view the images on and simply copy the thread number (000000) in the url address bar,</br>
and paste in in the new URL with your selected Thread number</br>
Original url: "https://boards.4chan.org/wg/thread/000000/POSTNAME" </br>
Break down of new URL:"https://a.4cdn.org/" + forum  + "/thread/" + Thread number + ".json" </br>
example of new URL: https://a.4cdn.org/wg/thread/000000.json </br></br>

with this add-on you will only see the images on the thread you selected, clicking a image will open the image in a new page.</br>
no more scrolling just to view the threads images.</br>
works best with a image hover add-on (might add this function in a future update).
