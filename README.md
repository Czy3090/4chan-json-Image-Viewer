# 4chan-json-Image-Viewer
View all images in a thread in a simple image only view, Change "Sub" and Thread "Number".
for Use with https://www.tampermonkey.net/ web browser extension

Choose the Thread post you want to view the images on and simply copy the thread number in the url address bar and paste in in the following url
"https://a.4cdn.org/" + forum  + "/thread/" + Thread number + ".json"
example: https://a.4cdn.org/wg/thread/000000.json

with this add-on you will only see the images on the thread you selected, clicking a image will open the image in a new page.
no more scrolling just to view the threads images.
works best with a image hover add-on (might add this function in a future update)
